Upon sign in, or upon clicking the "Home" button on the nav bar, the user will be taken to a page where they may view a list of their saved dogs - with name, breed, and either a previously uploaded image or a placeholder image. For each dog, an image will be displayed, underneath which the user will see their dog's name and breed. A user may click the "Add new dog" button to reach a form where they may enter a new dog's information - name, breed, age, activity level, and whether the dog is neutered/spayed, as well as upload an image for their dog. Upon saving the dog's information, they will be returned to the dog list, now with the new dog's information.

They may edit the details of any food they have personally entered by clicking the "Edit" button which will direct them to a form when they may change the food's details. Upon saving those details, they will be returned to the updated "Food/ List" page. A user may add a new food by clicking the "Add New Food" button.

## Adding an individual entry to a dog
To add a food or exercise entry for their dog, a user may click the name or brand of the food or exercise in the list. Clicking will generate a modal containing a form. This form will conditionally render with the item's name prefilled. User will be able to choose a dog for either entry, then enter a time (in minutes) for exercises, and number of servings for foods. Clicking the "Submit" button on the modal will close the modal while posting their new entry to the database.

## Dog Summary Page
A user may click the image associated with a dog on their dog list/home page to view that dog's summary page. The summary page will have the individual dog's information at the top, along either a previously uploaded picture or a placeholder image. Under this information, a user may record their dog's weight. The three most recent weigh ins are available to view underneath, along with a graph that shows the dog's weight changes over time. There are also graphs showing the dog's weight over time, exercise activity over time, and caloric intake over time (each totaled by date).

Previously entered food entries are grouped, by date, underneath with a header displaying the day of the entries and a calculated calorie total. Previously entered exercise entries are also grouped by date, displaying the date header and total time spent exercising for that day.

User may click the "Add New Food Entry" or "Add New Exercise Entry" to be returned to the food or exercise list, respectively, where they may make a new entry for their dog.

User may click the "Edit" button on any entry to display a modal with the dog's name and the name of the food/exercise previously entered pre-rendered. User may then make changes to the number of servings or time (in minutes) spent exercising. If a user enters something other than a number for either field, they will receive a helpful error message. Upon clicking "Submit", their entry's information will be saved and update in the dog summary page, displaying with an updated total calorie count/time spent header in the appropriate day.

User may delete any individual entry by clicking the "Delete" button on the entry, which will update their list and the appropriate total time/calorie headers for that day.
